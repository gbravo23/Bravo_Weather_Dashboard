# Bravo's Weather Dashboard

In this app, the traveler enters the name of a city in the search field located on the left hand side of the page. The traveler then clicks the search button and the app will display the current weather conditions in that city. This includes the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and a 5-day forecast for the city that was searched. The 5 day forcast also displays images showing the climate for that day (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.).

Every time the traveler searches for a city, the search history saves below. When the traveler searches for a new city, the previous city searched is saved below. This app is great for travelers who want to know the weather in advance for the city they might plan on traveling to.
